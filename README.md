# utokyo-exams
A repository where i publish tasks from previous years of utokyo masters entrance exams (mathematics, physics) and my solutions to these problems

#### Mathematics
All the versions of mathematics exam as of late 2024 were uploaded from utokyo's web page (https://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/soe/admission/general-past), uploaded for each year, english version filtered and then english versions for each year merged into one file - available in the current repo as **utokyo math all years eng 22112024.pdf** (https://github.com/kenkyuusha/utokyo-exams/blob/f6f656bb21afe07e9448d969a332244ae403c06b/utokyo%20math%20all%20years%20eng%2022112024.pdf). 

#### Physics
Currently the same is not yet done to physics entrance exams, a similar file is be added later. 

#### File naming
All files end with a data string in the format DDMMYYYY. This is the date when the file was created, and it simplifies working with files as quick scan of a list of any number of files can lead to understanding which of them are more recent. Of course, this can be done through sorting on date, but I believe it is better to have this information explicitly available in the naming.
